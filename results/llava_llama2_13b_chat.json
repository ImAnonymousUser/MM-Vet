    "v1_217": "The diagram below illustrates the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's (BoM) system for collecting and analyzing weather data. The BoM uses a combination of ground-based weather stations, radar systems, and satellite imagery to gather information on various weather conditions. This data is then transmitted to a central computer system, where it is analyzed and processed to produce accurate and reliable weather forecasts. The system also includes a television and radio network, which helps disseminate the forecasts to the public. The BoM's comprehensive approach to weather data collection and analysis ensures that it can provide accurate and timely information to the public, helping them make informed decisions about their daily activities and safety."
